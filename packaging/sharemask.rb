# Homebrew cask for sharemask. Lives in the tap repo github.com/Larry8668/homebrew-sharemask
# as Casks/sharemask.rb; this copy is the source of truth, synced on each release.
#
#   brew tap Larry8668/sharemask
#   brew trust Larry8668/sharemask        # Homebrew 7+ requires trusting third-party taps
#   brew install --cask sharemask
#
# The app is signed with a self-signed certificate (stable, so the Screen Recording grant survives
# updates) but is not notarised, so Gatekeeper would refuse the quarantined download. The
# postflight below removes the quarantine attribute (Homebrew 7 dropped --no-quarantine).

  caveats <<~EOS
    sharemask is not notarised; the quarantine flag was removed so it opens normally. If macOS
    still refuses, right-click the app and choose Open once. On first launch grant Screen Recording
    in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen & System Audio Recording.
